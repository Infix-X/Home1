Let's do a dry run of the provided Java code with a sample array to understand how it works. We'll use the following input:

java
Copy code
int[] arr = {1, -2, 3, -4, 5};
int n = 5;
Here's the step-by-step dry run of the code:

Initialize ans as an empty list: ans = [].

Initialize t to 1 (as the first element of the array is positive): t = 1.

Start iterating through the array:

i = 0: The first element is 1, which is positive. Since t is 1, we change t to 0 to start a positive subsequence.
We continue iterating:
i = 1: The next element is -2, which is negative. We continue.
i = 2: The next element is 3, which is positive. We change t back to 1 and continue.
i = 3: The next element is -4, which is negative. We continue.
i = 4: The next element is 5, which is positive. We change t back to 0 and continue.
In the first part of the iteration, we identify a positive subsequence [1, 3, 5]. We add the maximum value from this subsequence, which is 5, to the ans list: ans = [5].

We continue the iteration from where we left off:

i = 4: The next element is 5, which is positive. Since t is 0, we change t to 1 to start a negative subsequence.
We continue iterating:
i = 5: The next element is the last element, which is 5. We calculate the maximum value from this subsequence, which is 5, and add it to the ans list: ans = [5, 5].
The loop ends as we have covered all elements in the array.

We call sumList(ans), which calculates the sum of the elements in the ans list, resulting in a sum of 10.

The code returns 10 as the maximum sum of elements in the fair subsequences.

So, the maximum sum of a fair subsequence in the given array is 10, and the code correctly calculates it.
